CPU: Brain of the computer which handles most general purpose tasks. Manages the OS, runs applications, processes logic, 
and exectues instructions for everything. Use precision, reliability and sequential processing such as code compilation,
database queries, and running most software.

GPU: Specialized for handling complex visual and mathematical calculations, especially those that can be performed in parallel. Used
for machine learning, scientific simulations, and high performance computing
