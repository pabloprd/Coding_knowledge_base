## Gene ontology
Organizational framework that defines terms describing gene product attributes across species
  - Ontology structure: Defined terms for molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. 

  - Gene annotation: Genes/gene products are annotated with specific GO terms based on evidence. These annotations are stored in databases and are easily accessible to annotate. 

  - Data input and analysis: Computational tools retrieve GO annotations for these genes from the database

  - Enrichment analysis: Statistical methods to determine which GO terms are most overrepresented in the gene list compared to what would be expected by chance. 

  - Interpretation and Visualization: Interpreted to understand the underlying biology

  - Integration and Sharing: can be used on the large scale
