# GENERAL PROJECT FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE HELPFUL FOR ME


## Create the framework
- Create the framework/workflow on a text document or in a notebook. Main idea/Question you are answering at the top, then broadly go over each step in the process
- Go over naming conventions, software needed, files and folders I plan to create
- I will be updating this over the course of the project as changes come up. 

## Make journal in google drive
- This is the place where I go over my errors, plans, and my problem solving over the course of the project
- General folder where I lose my shit

## Setting up files and folders
- On the shared google drive create the folders and entry files you need to make
- On my own computer download those same folders and within that organizational structure begin to write out the psuedocode for EACH step of the way
- Make sure to create small to medium sized coding files that save the output within the folder structure so it is easier to load, and interact with and show the data


## THEN YOU CAN BEGIN CODING
