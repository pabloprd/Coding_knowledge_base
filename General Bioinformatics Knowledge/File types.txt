# File types what they mean and why they are important

SRA: Binary file format used to store raw DNA sequencing data from next generation sequencing
- Standard for SRA, compressed

FASTQ: Has an identifier line, nucleotide sequence line, plus sign line, quality scores
- Text based, standard format for raw sequencing data produced by high throughput sequencing machines like illumina

SAM: Text based human readable alignment info for reach read mapped to a reference genome
- Has info like reference sequence name, mapping position, mapping quality, CIGAR string, etc.

BAM: Binary compressed version of SAM. Has all the information as the above except in very compact form

FTP: Standard network protcol used to transfer files between computers over a TCP/IP network such as the internet. 

CEL : Data file format primarily used in microarry experiments. Intensity calculations for each spot on a microarray chip.
