If a path is not set it will be impossible to call the executables and the functions you want unless you are in that directory

With turning SRA into fastq file using the sra-tools I have installed:
fasterq-dump 
for %f in (*.sra) do fasterq-dump "%f"

#This command iterates through the directory finding every sra file and doing the fasterq dump on them. It is called the for variable or metavariable. For every sra file found %f takes the value of that file's name and the command after do is executed using that value.
