#Here are a list of r commands that I think are important to note and that I find useful


#Reading in a file

read.csv

#Listing files
list.files(path = "your/directory/path"

#Renaming a column
colnames(df)[colnames(df) == "old" ] <- "New name"

#Making a dictionary
SetNames (list1, list2)

#Dropping a column
df$column_name <- NULL

#Selecting a row
table[rowname, column] #or# table[rowname,]

#Summary statistics:
Summary()
Mean()
sd()
var()
min(), max()
quantile()

#Finding a string within a string
grepl(string)


#List applies
lapply(list or df, function, optional argument) <- always returns a list. Iterates through each element of x and applies the funciton to it

sapply() <- tries to simplify the output to a vector or matrix if possible

vapply() <- similar to sapply but requires you to specify expected data type

mapply() <- multivvariate version of lapply. Applies function to multiple vectors and list

#filling all na values in R
df[is.na(df)] <- "Unknown"


#To make bottom margins longer for plots
par(mar = c(8, 4, 4, 2) + 1.0)

#Selecting only columns that start with "O" in R
df_selected <- df %>% select(starts_with("0"))

#Selecting the column names that contain a letter
df_selected <- df %>% select(which(grepl("M", names(df))))

#Selecting a sepcific index
